                    <p>Insight Beam is here to help you in your search for a book that is worth it. We know what it feels like when
                        you judge a book by its cover and it looks good but you do not know what is inside. You do not want to spend
                        your hard-earned money on something that looked like gold from far but it is just cheap glitter up close.
